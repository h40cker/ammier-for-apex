# Yolo v8 Aim Assist

## For a more Specific guide, please refer to this [repo](https://github.com/Chalkeys/Yolov8-Apex-Aim-assist-with-IFF). Thank Chalkeys for the detailed guide!

## How to set up the environment

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

if you have a cuda capable gpu, you can running the following extra command

`pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 torchvision==0.14.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116`

### Using TensorRT to accelerate (Optional)
Add the following command
```
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip --user
pip install nvidia-pyindex
pip install --upgrade nvidia-tensorrt
pip install pycuda
```
If you can't install tensorrt in this way, you can look up this [Nvidia guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/archives/tensorrt-601/tensorrt-install-guide/index.html#installing-zip)


You have to transform the '.pt' model to '.trt' model by yourself, because the Tensorrt engines are environment specific. This repo may helpful: [TensorRT-For-YOLO-Series](https://github.com/Linaom1214/TensorRT-For-YOLO-Series)


## How to run the program
just run the `main.py` file with the following command

`python main.py`

After a few seconds, the program will start to run. You can see `Main Start` in the console.

Once you hold the right mouse button or the left mouse button (no matter you hold to aim or start shooting), the program will start to aim at the enemy.

## How to change the settings
You can change the settings in the `args.py` file.

### Some important settings!!!:
- model
    - The default model is for Apex. However, you can train your own model using `train.py`, and switch the model using this setting.
    - There're several model in the "model" dir, you can choose one of them.
        - The `.trt` models are for tensorRT, which is about 4 times faster than the `.pt` models, but with the same accuracy. 
        - Model speed: `8n>8s>8m`
        - Model accuracy: `8n<8s<8m`
- crop_size
    - This setting determines the portion of the screen to be detected. Too high may cause difficulty in detecting little objects.
